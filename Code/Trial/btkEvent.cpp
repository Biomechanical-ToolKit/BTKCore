   * @class Event btkEvent.h
   * @brief Label a specific time.
   *
   * An event is defined by:
   *  - a name;
   *  - a time (in seconds);
   *  - a context (e.g. "Right" side, "Left" side, or "General" context);
   *  - a subject associated with this event
   *  - a description which could give more details about the event
   *
   * All these information can be accessed/modified by using dedicated accessor/mutator but also using the property() and setProperty() method.
   * The name of properties are (in the same order than the previous list):
   *  - name
   *  - time
   *  - context
   *  - subject
   *  - description
   *
   * A time can be positive, null, or negative. The null time indicates the start of the recording, while a negative and postive time corresponds to an event before and after the beginning of the recording, respectively.
   *
   * There is no standard for the definition of a context. However, it is common to use the following context for task analysis:
   * - Right: Any event associated with the right side of the (human) body
   * - Left: Any event associated with the left side of the (human) body
   * - General: Any other event which cannot be assigned to the left or the right side of the body
   * The role of the context may be important or not depending of your later data processing/analysis.
   * For example, inside a clinical gait analysis you can have several "Foot Strike" and "Foot Off" events assigned to the "Right" and "Left" sides.
   * You could want to retrieve the events by name or by context or both. Thus, choosing a common orthography could help you as well as other researchers.
   * The previous example could be implemented like in the following code. The important thing to remind is the case used for any string assigned (name, context, subject, ...)
   *
   * @code
   * // Several events are defined in the node "Events".
   * // A algorithm could have generated the following events
   * btk::Node* events = new btk::Node("Events");
   * new btk::Event("Foot Strike",1.3,"Right","JDoe",&events);
   * new btk::Event("Foot Off",2.4,"Right","JDoe",&events);
   * new btk::Event("Foot Strike",1.8,"Left","JDoe",&events);
   * new btk::Event("Foot Off",3.0,"Left","JDoe",&events);
   * // Later in the code, you could retrive only:
   * // Events with the context "Right"
   * std::list<btk::Event*> rightEvents = events.findChild<btk::Event*>({},{{"context","Right"}});
   * // Events with the name "Foot Strike"
   * std::list<btk::Event*> footStrikeEvents = events.findChild<btk::Event*>("Foot Strike");
   * @endcode
   *
   * The subject's identification is used to distinguish events between subject which are in the same trial (if any).
   *
   * @ingroup BTKCommon
