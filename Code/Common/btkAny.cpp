   * @class Any btkAny.h
   * @brief Generic type to store and convert C++'s normal strict and static type.
   *
   * As the C++ language is a strong typed language it is not possible to use the 
   * same variable to hold an integer, a real, or a string.
   * In most of the cases, this is not a problem as this is a feature of the C++ language.
   * However, some applications would require to store different kind of data in a same
   * variable (like a database's fields). There are already existing solutions like
   * union keyword in the C++ language, Boost::Variant, Boost::Any, or QVariant solution.
   * However, some of them are only definable at compile time (union, Boost::Variant) 
   * or cannot freely convert stored value between different types (e.g. string to integer)
   * like Boost::Any. In case the stored type is not known at run-time and the use of the
   * run-time type information (RTTI) mechanism is discouraged, only the Qt class 
   * QVariant gives the possibity to store a generic content and convert it (if possible)
   * in the desired type. However, the use of QVariant means you need to link your code
   * the QtCore module which could be very heavy if you have a lightweight project.
   * Moreover, QVariant could support more type than desired (QColor, QFont, QByteArray, etc.)
   *
   * The class btk::Any was implemented to have a similiar behaviour than QVariant using
   * the Boost naming convention. Indeed, the purpose of btk::Any is closer of 
   * Boost::Any than Boost::Variant.
   *
   * The implementation of the class btk::Any relies heavily on the features introduced
   * in the C++11 revision of the C++ standard (constexpr, variadic templates, 
   * initializer lists, static assertions, rvalue, move, etc.).
   *
   * The internal behaviour of the class is mostly composed of two elements:
   *  - A type-erasure storage containing the data
   *  - A static table (std::unordered_map) containing all the known conversions between registered types.
   *
   * By default, the table gives the possibility to convert boolean, integers (int*_t),
   * reals (float, double) and string (std::string) between them. For example.
   *
   * @code
   * btk::Any a(5); // store an integer with the value 5
   * int ifive = a; // will contain the value 5.
   * std::string str = a; // will contain the string "5".
   * bool active = a; // will be set to true.
   * float ffive = a; // will store the value 5.0f.
   * a = "something else"; // And now 'a' contains a string
   * ifive = a; // invalid conversion, the stored value is now 0.
   * str = a; // Will contain the string "something else".
   * active = a; // Still the value is equal to true.
   * ffive = a; // Invalid conversion, the stored value is set to 0.0f
   * @endcode
   *
   * It is possible to register new types verified at compile time.
   * For this, the type must answer to two requirements:
   * - Have a valid default constructor
   * - Have an non-member equal operator
   *
   * One template specialization is at least required to define the type ID associated.
   * For example, if you want to register the class @c Date defined as:
   *
   * @code
   * struct Date
   * {
   *   int Year, Month, Day;
   *   friend bool operator==(const Date& lhs,const Date& rhs) {return ((lhs.Year == rhs.Year) && (lhs.Month == rhs.Month) && (lhs.Day == rhs.Day));};
   * };
   * @endcode
   *
   * The private class Any::Traits must be specialized to define the type ID.
   * Note: The use of the enum value Any::TraitsBase::User is important as it is used 
   * to distinguish builtin and user types. This value is used in case you want to 
   * unregister a type. Only user's type can be unregistered. The ID values available 
   * for user type are ranged between 1024 and 65535.
   *
   * @code
   * template<> struct btk::Any::Traits<Date> : btk::Any::TraitsBase
   * {
   *   enum {ID = Any::TraitsBase::User + 1}; // 1025
   * };
   * @endcode
   *
   * It is then possible to register a type using the btk::Any::Register command.
   *
   * @code
   * // Must be in a function. For example the main(). The scope of the registration
   * // is valid until the end of the program.
   * btk::Any::Register<Date, btk::converter<Date>, btk::converter<>>();
   * //                  ^^^^
   * //      Registered type
   * //                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   * //        A Date stored in a btk::Any object can be
   * //      converted to these types (In this example, a
   * //  stored Date is convertible only to a Date object)
   * //                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   * //                           A Date object can be created from another type
   * //                                         (none available in this example)
   * @endcode
   *
   *
   * In case other conversions are intended. the internal converter must be 
   * specialized in consequence. For example, if a @c Date can be converted to a
   * @c std::string or created from a @c std::string, two specializations are required.
   *
   * @code
   * template<>
   * // From std::string to Date.
   * struct btk::Any::Converter::Helper<std::string,Date> : btk::Any::Converter::HelperBase<std::string,Date>
   * {
   *   // Fake conversion. The goal is only the show the specialization of the converter. 
   *   static inline Date convert(const std::string& ) {return Date{2009,05,02};};
   * };
   *
   * // From Date to std::string.
   * template<>
   * struct btk::Any::Converter::Helper<Date,std::string> : btk::Any::Converter::HelperBase<Date,std::string>
   * {
   *   static inline std::string convert(const Date& val) {return std::to_string(val.Year) + "-" + std::to_string(val.Month) + "-" + std::to_string(val.Day);};
   * };
   * @endcode 
   * 
   * The registration in the conversion table would be then:
   * @code
   * btk::Any::Register<Date, btk::converter<Date,std::string>, btk::converter<std::string>>();
   * @endcode
   *
   * In case a user type has to be unregistered (e.g. plugin unloaded), the command 
   * btk::Any::Unregister must be called.
   * @code
   * // The next line unregisters all the conversions related to a Date object. 
   * // You can still store a Date object in btk::Any, but all conversions will be 
   * // not valid.
   * btk::Any::Unregister<Date>();
   * btk::Any a(Date{2009,05,02});
   * btk::Date empty = a; // No conversion is known, the returned Date is empty.
   * @endcode
   *
