   * This class is used only to determine if node's children can be cast to a specfic derived class (see Node:findChild(), Node::findChildren().
   * However the code is universal and could be used with any type. Indeed, the identifier is unique for any type (i.e. nodeid<int>() != nodeid<float>() != nodeid<Node>() != nodeid<Node*>() != nodeid<const Node>(), etc.)
