   * @brief Analog channel data along the time.
   *
   * An analog channel is defined as:
   *  - a set of data samples;
   *  - a unit;
   *  - a scale;
   *  - an offset;
   *  - a gain.
   *
   * The data samples are is stored in a Analog::Data object.
   * 
   * The use of the unit, scale, offset and gain are useful for other classes/methods. For example, when you save an acquisition in a file, analog's data are generally unscaled and written as integer, then the scale and offset are important.
