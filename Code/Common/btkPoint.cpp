  /**
   * @class Point btkPoint.h
   * @brief Coordinates of a point in a 3D space along the time.
   *
   * The coordinates of the point are generally measured by an acquisition system. For each frame, the
   * 3D value has a residual. It can provide informations on the quality of these 3D data 
   * (residual associated with the reconstruction of the marker). These values are stored in a Point::Data object.
   * 
   * This class is also used to represent angles, forces, moments, powers and scalars. 
   * To know/set the type of the point, you can use the methods GetType() and SetType(). 
   * 
   * Note: In some case the values at specific frames are invalid (mainly due to marker's occlusion).
   * To detect if the frame is invalid, you can check the residual which will be 
   * set to the value -1. It is the same thing if you want to set the frame as invalid. You can set
   * the values of the frames to 0 and the associated residual to -1.
   * 
   * Note: A residual with a value equal to 0 means that this frame has been post-processed (interpolation, filtering, etc.).
