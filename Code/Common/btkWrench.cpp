   * @class Wrench btkWrench.h
   * @brief Represents a wrench as position, force and moment varying during the time.
   *
   * This class is mainly used to have a compact way to store forces and moment acting (or reacting) at a given position.
   * The moment should be expressed at the position as it is defined in general mechanics.
   *
   * By default, the label used for the forces and the moments corresponds to the given label to the constructor and followed by the suffix ".F" and ".M" respectively.
