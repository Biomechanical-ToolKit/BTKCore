  /**
   * @class GroundReactionWrenchFilter btkGroundReactionWrenchFilter.h
   * @brief Transform force platform data into ground reaction wrenches.
   *
   * Theses wrenches are expressed in the global frame. The point of application (PWA)
   * of each wrench is calculated from Shimba (1984).
   * Compared to the center of pressure (COP), the PWA take into account all the forces
   * and moments (and does not assume any null forces).
   *
   * Note: For gait analysis, the COP and PWA are very similar.
   *
   * Because the computation of the PWA (as the COP) is sensitive to small (vertical) forces, the methods 
   * SetThresholdValue and SetThresholdState() are provided to not compute the PWA if the vertical forces is
   * the threshold. You first need to set the value and then activate the threshold method.
   * By default, this threshold is not activated and the values is set to 0.
   * As for example:
   * @code
   * btk::GroundReactionWrenchFilter::Pointer grwf = btk::GroundReactionWrenchFilter::New()
   * grwf->SetThresholdValue(5.0); // 5 newtons
   * grwf->SetThresholdState(true);
   * @endcode
   *
   * Finally, you can also use the method SetTransformToGlobalFrame() to have the wrench expressed in the frame of the force platform.
