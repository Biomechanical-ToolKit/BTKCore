   * @brief Writer of acquisition data into acquisition file (C3D, TRC, ...).
   *
   * @note The detection of the helper class to use creates a new object (inheriting of btk::AcquisitionFileIO). Then, if a previous or empty btk::AcquisitionFileIO pointer was given to another filter, it doesn't correspond to the newly detected btk::AcquisitionFileIO. For example:
   * @code
   * btk::AcquisitionFileReader::Pointer reader = btk::AcquisitionFileReader::New();
   * reader->SetFilename("...");
   * btk::AcquisitionFileWriter::Pointer writer = btk::AcquisitionFileWriter::New();
   * writer->SetAcquisitionIO(reader->GetAcquisitionIO());
   * writer->SetInput(reader->GetOutput());
   * writer->SetFilename("...");
   * writer->Update();
   * @endcode
   * This code give to the writer an empty btk::FileAcquisitionIO. When the writer is updated, it updates also the reader which detects the btk::FileAcquisitionIO corresponding to the given file. However, the writer has the old (empty) value and will detect the btk::FileAcquisitionIO to used instead of using the same as the reader.\n
   * To use the same btk::FileAcquisitionIO, the reader must be updated before the use of the method btk::AcquisitionFileWriter::SetAcquisitionIO.
   * @code
   * btk::AcquisitionFileReader::Pointer reader = btk::AcquisitionFileReader::New();
   * reader->SetFilename("...");
   * reader->Update(); // <-- Line to add
   * btk::AcquisitionFileWriter::Pointer writer = btk::AcquisitionFileWriter::New();
   * writer->SetAcquisitionIO(reader->GetAcquisitionIO());
   * writer->SetInput(reader->GetOutput());
   * writer->SetFilename("...");
   * writer->Update();
   * @endcode
