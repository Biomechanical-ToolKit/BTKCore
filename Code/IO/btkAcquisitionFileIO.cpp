  /**
   * @class AcquisitionFileIO btkAcquisitionFileIO.h
   * @brief Interface to read/write acquisition's files.
   *
   * A class inheriting from AcquisitionFileIO has to implement 4 methods:
   *  - CanReadFile
   *  - Read
   *  - CanWriteFile
   *  - Write
   * It is also strongly adviced to give the default file extension(s) used by this file format. This last property is
   * used by the IO factory in the methods AcquisitionFileIOFactory::GetSupportedReadExtensions and AcquisitionFileIOFactory::GetSupportedWriteExtensions
   *
   * To help developers, some macros were defined in case:
   *  - the class reads only files and doesn't write them: BTK_FILE_IO_ONLY_READ_OPERATION ;
   *  - the class write only files and doesn't read them: BTK_FILE_IO_ONLY_WRITE_OPERATION ;
   *  - but also to set the file extension supported: BTK_FILE_IO_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS.
   *
   * These macros should be used at the top of the declaration of the new class. For example:
   * @code
   * class FooFileIO : public AcquisitionFileIO
   * {
   *   BTK_FILE_IO_ONLY_READ_OPERATION;
   *   BTK_FILE_IO_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS("FOO");
   * public:
   *   // ...
   *   virtual bool CanReadFile(const std::string& filename);
   *   virtual void Read(const std::string& filename, Acquisition::Pointer output);
   *   // ...
   * };
   * @endcode
   *
   * In this example, the FooFileIO class can only read files, and the default file extension known is "FOO".
   * @note Check the class AcquisitionFileIO::Extension to add more than one default extension.
   *
   * After the implementation of the new IO, you can decide to add it to the factory (using the method AcquisitionFileIOFactory::AddFileIO). This will give the possibility to 
   * select the new IO automatically based on the return value of the method CanReadFile() or CanWriteFile().
   *
   * For inheriting classes which implement the Write() method, it is possible to select the way the internal configuration (if any) is updated based on the acquisiton input.
   * By default, the internal member m_InternalsUpdate is set to AcquisitionFileIO::UpdateNotApplicable. Two other choices are proposed to update the internal: based on data (points, analog channels, events) (AcquisitionFileIO::DataBasedUpdate) or based on metadata (AcquisitionFileIO::MetaDataBasedUpdate).
   * These options are only informative and it is up to each file format to use this information of not.
   * It is also possible to extend the options used to update each file format internals by using the enum value AcquisitionFileIO::FileFormatOption.
   * For example, the C3D file format has an option (C3DFileIO::CompatibleVicon = AcquisitionFileIO::FileFormatOption) to keep generated file compatible with the software Polygon (Vicon, version 3.5) which crash if some parameters' description is empty.
   *
   * @note The methods to set the file type, the byte order or the storage format are in 
   * general not used as lots of file format doesn't have options for these properties.
   * Only the C3D file format is known to have some options each time.
