   * @class IODevice btkIODevice.h
   * @brief Interface to read and write on any type of device (e.g. File, Buffer, etc.).
   *
   * There is two types of devices. The first one is called "random access" (e.g. File, Buffer), while the second is called "sequential" (e.g. SerialPort).
   * The use of a IODevice class should be used with a BinaryStream or TextStream which interact at a higher level to read/write data in a device.
   *
   * This interface proposes also an exception mechanism in case the device fails to do some internal operation, or if there are error during I/O operations.
   * You can use the method setExceptions() to set the states which can trigger an exception. The exception thrown by this class corresponds to a IODevice::Failure exception.
   *
   * To implement a new device, several methods must me implemented. To facilitate this implementation some protected methods are proposed like verifyMode().
