   *
   * The use of this class gives you the possibility in one line to redirect the logs sent to the debug logger (btk::Logger::Debug()) during the execution
   * of the MEX function. Automaticaly at the end of the function (or the scope of the variable set), the redirection is reseted.

   *   ... // Do what you want
   *   btk::Logger::Debug("Simple example to show you that this line will be printed in the Matlab console.");
